Execute the Python
You can easily open the .py file by following code:

  exec(open("/Users/kylehang/Desktop/SP500.py").read())

After this, the SP500 list will gather from WIKIPEDIA lively
and also generate an local sql database file.

Use "DB Browser for SQLite" to view the database
or by SQL Query in python shell
